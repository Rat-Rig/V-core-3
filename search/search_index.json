Order the V-Core 3.1 This kit is the culmination of Rat Rig's accumulated years of experience designing, producing and distributing DIY 3D Printer kits worldwide. Originally introduced in 2017, the V-Core went through several iterations and multiple variants over time, through a process of continuously seeking user feedback to drive product development. The lessons learned over the years allowed us to understand what works and what doesn't, what features are most valued by users, and what choices ensure both quality and affordability. We've distilled all this knowledge into the V-Core 3, which was designed in partnership with Pawel Kucmus, a long time member of our on-line community and one of the most prolific contributors to the V-Core platform. Precision \u00b6 3 Point Kinematic Bed Bed plates expand as they heat up. If their mounting points are unmovable, the bed will have no room to expand to the sides, and it will be forced to bow (either upwards or downwards). The V-Core 3 bed plate is not rigidly connected to the machine's frame. Instead, 3 steel balls connected to the bed sit on low friction dowel pins. The pins act like a pair of rails for the steel balls, guiding their movement as the bed expands and ensuring that only radial movement is possible - there's zero margin for lateral movement. This means that while your plate is firmly in place, it can still remain perfectly flat as it expands. Since the bed only has 3 mounting points, which are connected to 3 independently driven Z motors, bed-levelling is exclusively determined by motor position and can be done 100% electronically - simple and instantaneous. 6mm Cast Tooling Plate for Print bed Bi-material Decouplers on Z arms ensure that any inconsistencies on the drivetrain won't be transmitted to the print surface XY Kinematics built to last All movement guided by MGN12 Linear Rails Doubled Z resolution with TR8x4 Lead Screws instead of TR8x8 The V-Core 3 uses 3 lead screws to drive the Z axis of the machine. They move the bed down in small increments, at the end of each complete layer. The Z axis moves very slowly, so speed is not the priority - precision and resolution are. The V-Core 3 uses TR8X4mm lead screws instead of the TR8x8mm used in previous machines, effectively halving the pitch of the lead screw - this means that each rotation of the motor, now moves the bed half as much. This both doubles the Z resolution of your layers and multiplies the holding torque - always helpful when you're moving such a heavy bed, especially on the larger variants. Robustness \u00b6 While previous V-Core versions, like many other printers on the market, relied solely on 20 Series profiles, the V-Core 3 is fully built on a 30 Series aluminium frame. From screws and nuts to brackets and plates, everything is bigger, stronger and tougher. Frame made with 30x30mm T-Slot aluminium with a beautiful black anodization 4mm thick anodized aluminium plates 9mm Belts Weight of Z drivetrain and bed is distributed across the Z motor mounts - not on the motors themselves Customization \u00b6 Available both as a complete kit and a configurable kit (for those who want to select their own electronics) Configurable options include LDO motors, Keenovo Heatpads, and multiple controller board options (from Duet3D, SKR, etc) 4 build volumes available as standard option: 200, 300, 400 and 500 mm3 Full End Stop solutions EVA 3 Carriage System provides mounts for most popular extruder and hot end choices on the market Shipping with EVA 3.0.2 What is EVA? EVA is an independently developed and maintained project that aims to be a single platform for many extrusion types. Note that not all print head types (due to their physical dimensions) can achieve the full 300x300 print space. EVA 3 is the next iteration of the EVA platform with which V-Core 3 is fully compatible. Read more about EVA on: EVA 3 Documentation Support \u00b6 Fully comprehensive step by step build guide (Both static and video) Fully comprehensive wiring and electronics guide for multiple controller boards Support configuration files for several firmware choices (Reprap, Marlin, Klipper) Join our Facebook 3D Printer Community to connect with other V-Core users, share builds, knowledge, mods, and stay posted on all V-Core 3 developments. Safety \u00b6 Wiring design includes multiple cable management parts, for cable clamping, guiding and strain relief Custom Keenovo Heat Pad with pre-wired 157\u00baC Thermal Fuse for extra safety (Optional). The wiring comes out of the pad slightly off-center, so it's neatly guided to the back of the machine without interfering with the bed mounting point at the back. For 120/220V Heat pad users, grounding point at the bed and fully isolated bed from the rest of the printer means that the printer frame is never conducting any dangerous voltages. Convenience \u00b6 Designed for a far easier and quicker assembly than previous versions Separate chamber for electronics ensures heat insulation, short motor cable path, easy access to all wiring, and a very clean installation. Panel for mounting electronics is not supplied, user is meant to source it locally. A 4mm thick polycarbonate sheet is suggested. Mounting screws and nuts are included as part of the base kit. DXF files with size, shape and hole patterns for the panels are provided on the project documentation. Electronics Panel should not be thicker than 4mm, otherwise it will not fit in the available space. Enclose Your V-Core 3 \u00b6 Enclosure Kit \u00b6 The V-Core 3 was designed from the ground up with full enclosing in mind, with no need for an external enclosure. The design ensures that all motors and electronics are safely placed outside the printing chamber, so they are shielded from high temperatures, and no machine elements protrude from the frame, ensuring that the frame can be directly covered with panels from all sides. The enclosure kit is the perfect solution for users who want to: - Use filaments that require high temperatures - Shield their printer from humidity, dust, drafts, etc - Shield their environment from printer noises and smells Extended \"Full Frame\" for a fully enclosed work area \u00b6 Double door access \u00b6 Top and front easy access doors with foam seals Magnetically latched doors with double handles \u00b6 Easily remove the most convenient door depending on your printer position New printed spool holder \u00b6 The new printed spool holder can be assembled outside the enclosure Suggested Filament Routing (Using PTFE Tube) \u00b6 All motors outside the heated chamber \u00b6 New full metal front idler mounts \u00b6 Easier installation and maintenance Optional \"Split Panel\" files and kit available for bigger printer sizes \u00b6 Y-Axis bumpers for optional Y-axis sensorless homing \u00b6 Not included \u00b6 The enclosing panels themselves are not supplied, the user is meant to source them locally. A 4mm thick polycarbonate sheet is suggested. DXF files with size, shape and hole patterns for the panels are provided on the project documentation. Printed parts are required and are also not supplied at the moment, the user will need to self-source them. More information on the printed part section below. Order the Enclosure 2.0 Kit Dimensions \u00b6 Modding \u00b6 The V-Core 3 is the perfect printer for advanced users who like to tweak and tinker with their machine: Fully open-source design, with downloadable 3D models and part libraries freely available Frame is built on a modular platform of T-Slot and V-Slot profiles, which allow for endless possibilites when it comes to mounting all types of parts Vast catalog of stand-alone parts available for infinite upgradeability: screws, nuts, connectors, brackets, pulleys, belts, electronics, etc For some inspiration, check out the V-Core 3 Gallery with builds from users worldwide Sample Prints / Parts \u00b6 These images showcase 3D prints produced by V-Core 3 machines belonging to members of our community. Clicking any image will open the full size version. Acknowledgments \u00b6 As an Open-source project, the V-Core 3 design is the result of prolonged brainstorming, testing, and collaboration between many active members of the international 3D Printer Community, who shared their knowledge and experience with our design team. As such, the machine inevitably draws inspiration from and builds upon many existing design elements that have been developed, shared, tested, modded, and iterated by the community at large. The nature of the open-source movement makes it often difficult to trace back where each idea was originally generated, making it hard to produce a comprehensive list of acknowledgments.

This is also a great resource to seek support, ask opinions to other users, and share ideas. The community is about much more than product support, though. This is where Rat Rig developers get to interact with their users, hear from them, understand their wants and needs, and define future product strategy in response to their feedback. It\u2019s also the place where more advanced users share mods they\u2019ve made to their machines to better suit their needs and preferences - and this is often a great source of inspiration, both to other users and to the Rat Rig team itself. Rat Rig 3D Printers are not the brainchild of Rat Rig in isolation. Instead, they are the result of a continuous and tight-knit feedback loop between users and developers. Join us and take part of this beautiful process that has been building on top of itself for many years and throughout many product iterations! Beta/Dev Team \u00b6 If you\u2019re passionate and knowledgeable about 3D Printing, you may be interested to learn that our Beta/Development Team is mostly made of users who at some point in time bought one of our printers and got involved in the community. Active and knowledgeable members who passionately contribute to the community don\u2019t go by unnoticed, and will sometimes be invited to join the team. If this is something that gets you excited, come and join us, connecting is always the first step on the Rat Rig journey! Beta/Dev users not only get to influence product strategy and design decisions, but also benefit from several awesome perks, like early access to products and discounted prices on all orders. Above everything else, they get to participate in extremely nerdy debates with like-minded people, and witness how those debates materialize over time in products who will be enjoyed by many people. Rat Rig 3D Printer Community Unofficial Community on Discord \u00b6 This community is run exclusively by Rat Rig users, there\u2019s no interference/moderation/monitoring by Rat Rig. Make sure you keep checking official sources too, to ensure you always have access to the most accurate/updated information. Even though this is an unofficial community, over time we\u2019ve found that this is one of the best resources for users seeking technical support. There are many knowledgeable and super helpful members on the server, and their response time is usually much shorter than what Rat Rig can provide as a company. The discord server is also the primary place to discuss and participate in the ongoing EVA development and testing. Rat Rig Community [Unofficial] Contributions \u00b6 V-Core 3 users (including a couple of prominent youtubers in the 3D printing space) have been customizing their machines and designing some really cool accessories, jigs and upgrades in the process! Some ideas have drawn considerable attention and interest, and we're very fortunate as a community that their creators are openly sharing their designs, for everyone to use. In the true spirit of the open-source movement, the hive mind has already taken hold of the project and started the never-ending process of continuous improvement - nothing could make us more excited than witnessing this! Below we offer a tutorial for users to submit their contributions so they can be reviewed by our team and added directly to the main V-Core 3 Repository, on GitHub. We invite all existing and future contributors to use this process, so we can have everything in the same place, for everyone's benefit! Thank you to all contributors for inspiring the community!
