Detlev Rackow, a member of Rat Rig's Beta/Dev team, provides SuperSlicer profiles for the V-Core 3 when running RatOS. As of version 2.3.57 these profiles are not included with SuperSlicer, and must be installed manually, but are planned to be intergrated in a future version.

### Obtaining SuperSlicer
SuperSlicer is a free and open-source project. It can be obtained directly from their [:material-github: GitHub repository](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer/releases)

### Installing the profiles in versions v2.3.57 and below
The following video shows how to manually obtain and install the profiles on SuperSlicer v2.3.57 and below:

    Although the video shows configuring SuperSlicer for the V-Minion, the process is identical for the V-Core 3. Simply choose the appropriate V-Core 3 profile for your machine size, instead of choosing the V-Minion.

The following video gives an overview on configuring SuperSlicer to connect with your V-Core 3:
